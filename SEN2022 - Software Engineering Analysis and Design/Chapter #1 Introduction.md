## What is engineering

- Engineering is the application of science and math to solve real life
  problems.
- Engineering is the use of scientific principles to analyze, design and
  build machines, structures, and other items, including bridges, tunnels,
  roads, vehicles, and buildings.

## Who is an Engineer

- Engineer is a professional who invent, analyze, design, build and
  test machines, complex systems, structures and materials to fulfill
  functional objectives and requirements while considering the
  limitations imposed by practicality, regulation, safety and
  cost

- An engineer figures out how things work and finds practical uses for
  scientific discoveries.

## What is Software Engineering

- Software Engineering is the systematic application of engineering
  approaches to the development of software.

## Who is a Software Engineer?

- A software engineer is a person who applies the principles of software
  engineering to the analysis, design, development, testing, deployment,
  maintenance, and evaluation of computer software.

### Main Components of SE

- People
  - project stakeholders
- Product
  - the software product plus associated documents
- Project
  - the activities carried out to produce the product
- Process
  - framework within which the team carries out the activities necessary to
    build the project

## Information System

### What is System

- A system is a collection of elements or components that are organized fora common purpose
- A system is a group of interacting or interrelated entities that form a unified whole

### What is Information System

- An **information system (IS)** is a formal, organizational system
  designed to collect, process, store, and distribute information

- A **computer information system** is a system composed of people and
  computers that processes or interprets information.

Information systems have five key components:

1. **Hardware** is the physical layer of the information system.
1. **Software** is the set of instructions that control hardware.
1. **Data** is the raw material that an information system transforms into useful
   information.
1. **Process** is a business function that users perform to achieve specific results.
1. **People** are the inside/outside users who interact with an IS.

## Systems Analysis and Design (SAD)

- **Systems Analysis and Design (SAD)** is a field in which analysts
  repetitively learn new approaches and different techniques for building
  the system more effectively and efficiently
* The primary objective of systems analysis and design is to improve
organizational systems.
* Systems Analysis and Design is a step-by-step process for developing
high-quality information systems.
* The purpose of systems analysis and design is:
  * to understand how an information system can support business needs
  * to analyze the system,
  * to design the system,
  * to deliver the system to users

## Four P's of Systems Analysis and Design

1. **People**  
  * Project *stakeholders*
  * Most important resource in a software development project.
  * Project success highly depends on their efforts.
2. **Product**
  * Project Documents
  * Code
  * Test documents
  * Customer documents
3. **Project**
  * Determining what's required
  * Determining how the software should be built to meet the requirements
  * Implementing the software
  * Testing the software
  * Maintaining the software once delivered to customers
4. **Process**
  * Framework within which the team carries out the activities necessary to
build the project, expresses the interrelationship among the phases by
defining their order and frequency, defines the deliverables of each activity
and the project
  * Specific software process implementations are called software process
models.

## Stakeholders
A stakeholder is any person who has an interest in an existing or
proposed information system.  
1.  System owner
1.  Project manager
1.  Systems analyst
1.  System designer
1.  System builder
1.  Software tester
1.  System user

**1. System Owner**  
System owner is usually responsible for funding the project of
developing, operating, and maintaining the information system.  
**2. Project Manager**  
Project manager is an experienced professional who accepts
responsibility for planning, monitoring, and controlling projects with
respect to schedule, budget, deliverables, customer satisfaction,
technical standards, and system quality.  
**3. Systems Analyst**  
Systems analyst is a specialist who studies the problems,
opportunities, directives and needs of an organization to determine
how people, data, processes, and information technology can best
accomplish improvements for the business.  
**4. Systems Designer**  
System designer is a technical specialist who translates business
requirements of system users and constraints into technical solution
**5. System Builder**  
System builder is a technical specialist who constructs information
systems and components based on the design specifications generated
by the system designers  
**6. Software Tester**  
Software tester is an individual that tests software for bugs, errors,
defects or any problem that can affect the performance of a computer
software or an application.  
**7. System User**  
System user is a “customer” who will use or is affected by an
information system on a regular basis – capturing, validating, entering,
responding to, storing and exchanging data and information.

## Software Development Life Cycle  
Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a process of creating or
altering information systems, and the models and methodologies that
people use to develop these systems.
