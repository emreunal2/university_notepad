## What is engineering
* Engineering is the application of science and math to solve real life
problems.
* Engineering is the use of scientific principles to analyze, design and
build machines, structures, and other items, including bridges, tunnels,
roads, vehicles, and buildings.

## Who is an Engineer

* Engineer is a professional who invent, analyze, design, build and
test machines, complex systems, structures and materials to fulfill
functional objectives and requirements while considering the
limitations imposed by practicality, regulation, safety and
cost 

* An engineer figures out how things work and finds practical uses for
scientific discoveries.

## What is Software Engineering
- Software Engineering is the systematic application of engineering
approaches to the development of software.

## Who is a Software Engineer?
* A software engineer is a person who applies the principles of software
engineering to the analysis, design, development, testing, deployment,
maintenance, and evaluation of computer software.
