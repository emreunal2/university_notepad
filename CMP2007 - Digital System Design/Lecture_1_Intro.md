# CMP 2007 Lecture 1: Intro

Most of notes from this Lecture is remember to last year.

## Basic Design Tradeofs

- Performance (speed)
- Cost (complexity)
- Power (energy dissipation)

> - Improve on one at the expense of the others
> - Tradeoffs exist at every level in the system design.

### Example Digital Systems:

- **Handheld Calculator**

  - Usually designed to minimize cost.
  - Optimized for low cost‚Äù
  - Of course, low cost comes at the expense of speed.

- **Digital Watch**
  - Designed to minimize power.
  - lower speed
  - higher cost

### Design Methodologies

- Top-Down Design

  - Starts at the top (root) and works down by
    successive refinement.

- Bottom-up Design
  - Starts at the leaves & puts pieces together to build
    up the design.

* Top-down to handle the complexity (divide and
conquer)
* Bottom-up since structure influenced by available
primitives
(in a well designed system)
