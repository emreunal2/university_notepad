# Lecture .Notes 3 Mathematical Analysis of Non-Recursive and Recursive Algorithms-Empirical Analysis of Algorithms

## Analyzing the Time Efficiency of **Nonrecursive Algorithms**

1. Decide on a parameter (or parameters) indicating an input’s size.
2. Identify the algorithm’s basic operation. (As a rule, it is located in the innermost loop.)
3. Check whether the number of times the basic operation is executed depends only on the size of an input. If it also depends on some additional property, the worst-case, average-case, and, if necessary, best-case efficiencies have to be investigated separately.
4. Set up a sum expressing the number of times the algorithm’s basic o.peration is executed.
5. Using standard formulas and rules of sum manipulation, either find a closedform formula for the count or, at the very least, establish its order of growth..

3. Check whether the number of times the basic operation is executed depends only on the size of an input. If it also depends on some additional property, the worst-case, average-case, and, if necessary, best-case efficiencies have to be investigated separately.
4. Set up a recurrence relation, with an appropriate initial condition, for the number of times the basic operation is executed
5. Solve the recurrence or at least, ascertain the order of growth of its solution.
